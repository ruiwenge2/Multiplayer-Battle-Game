# MultiplayerBattleGame

Do you remember my battle game made in Python?

Well, this time I've spent a few weeks making a multiplayer version of the game with Node.js using Socket.IO, and it's a website now!

## Features
 - See your opponents moves in real time
 - Chat box to communicate with your opponent
 - Inviting users to a room
 - Play against the computer


Here's what it looks like:

*Important: To create an account you must open the website in a new tab.*
